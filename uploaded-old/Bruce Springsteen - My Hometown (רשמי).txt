My Hometown

I was eight years old 

And running with a dime in my hand 

To the bus stop to pick 

Up a paper for my old man 

I'd sit on his lap 

In that big old Buick 

And steer as we drove through town 

He'd tousle my hair 

And say, "son, 

Take a good look around" 

This is your hometown 

This is your hometown 

This is your hometown 

This is your hometown" 

In '65 tension was running high 

At my high school 

There was a lot of fights 

Between the black and white 

There was nothing you could do 

Two cars at a light 

On a Saturday night 

In the back seat there was a gun 

Words were passed 

In a shotgun blast 

Troubled times had come 

To my hometown 

To my hometown 

To my hometown 

To my hometown 

Now Main Street's 

Whitewashed windows 

And vacant stores 

Seems like there ain't nobody 

Wants to come down here no more 

They're closing down 

The textile mill 

Across the railroad tracks 

Foreman says 

"these jobs are going, boys 

And they ain't coming back 

To your hometown 

To your hometown 

To your hometown 

To your hometown" 

Last night me and Kate 

We laid in bed 

Talking about getting out 

Packing up our bags 

Maybe heading south 

I'm thirty-five 

We got a boy of our own now 

Last night I sat him up 

Behind the wheel 

And said, "son, 

Take a good look around 

This is your hometown"

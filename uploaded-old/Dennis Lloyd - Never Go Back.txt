I never go back 

No, no, no 

I never go 

I never go back 

I never go back 

No, no, no 

I never go 

I never go back 

It's not my baby 

Not the girl I knew then 

Not the girl I know now, anymore 

I wanna leave you 

Baby don't you leave me 

Baby don't you love me Mi amor 

Always look around girl 

Tryna see the good things 

Why you'd always say 

That you never done wrong 

Why you never hold me 

Tell me that you love me 

Why you'd always say 

That you'd never let go 

I never go back 

No, no, no 

I never go 

I never go back 

I never go back 

No, no, no 

I never go 

I never go back 

I wanna do this 

I don't wanna do this 

Girl, we shouldn't do this anymore 

Quiero dejarte, ¿no me necesitas 

¿Por qué siempre dices 

Eso mi amor 

Always look around girl 

Tryna see the good things 

Why you'd always say 

That you never done wrong 

Why you never hold me 

Tell me that you love me 

Why you'd always say 

That you'd never let go 

I never go back

I wanna leave you, wanna leave you 

But I can't let go (I can't do it) 

I wanna leave you, wanna leave you

I wanna leave you, wanna leave you 

But I can't let go (I can't do it) 

I wanna leave you, wanna leave you 

But I can't let go (I can't do it)

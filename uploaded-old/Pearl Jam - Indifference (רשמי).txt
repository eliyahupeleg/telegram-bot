I will light the match this mornin' 

 

So i won't be alone 

 

Watch as she lies silent 

 

For soon light will be gone 

 

I will stand arms outstretched 

 

Pretend i'm free to roam 

 

I will make my way, through 

 

One more day in hell 

 

How much difference does it make 

 

How much difference does it make 

 

I will hold the candle till 

 

It burns up my arm 

 

I'll keep takin' punches 

 

Until their will grows tired 

 

I will stare the sun down 

 

Until my eyes go blind 

 

Hey i won't change direction 

 

And i won't change my mind 

 

How much difference does it make 

 

How much difference does it make 

 

How much difference 

 

I'll swallow poison 

 

Until i grow immune 

 

I will scream my lungs out 

 

Till it fills this room 

 

How much difference 

 

How much difference 

 

How much difference does it make 

 

How much difference does it make

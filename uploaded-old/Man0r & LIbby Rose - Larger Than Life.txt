You wanted this for so long,
it's so close, on the tip of your tongue.
The burning heat of a great light,
can you feel it it's larger than life (x4)
Wow oh.. x4
The moment is yet to come,
the heart beats just like a drum.
In this, just hold tight.
can you feel It's larger than life (x4)
Ho Ho
Wow oh x4
"I can't believe this is happening,
right here, right in front of me.
Can't stop thinking, got to stop thinking -
Just feel, feel.."
Here and now,
feels so right.
Can't resist.
Own it
Don't dare to stop,
dare to fight.
Become Larger than life

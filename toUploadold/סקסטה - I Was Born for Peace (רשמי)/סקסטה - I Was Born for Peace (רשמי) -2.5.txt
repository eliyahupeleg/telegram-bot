I was born to sing
In all my life I've sought
To sing a song of peace
It's peace I've always told
(Oh) I was born to say
Wherever I may be
It's not for me alone
But each one on his own
Chorus: x2
I dream of peace in all the world, oh let it be now
I dream of love and harmony, so let it be
I dream of peace in all the world, so let me see how
I want the world to sing a peaceful melody
I was born to dream
See it all come true
And bring on the day
Of peace for me and you
I know I have the will
I know it's coming near
Come into my home
After thirty years
Chorus: x2
I dream of peace in all the world, oh let it be now
I dream of love and harmony, so let it be
I dream of peace in all the world, so let me see how
I want the world to sing a peaceful melody
For two thousand years
My people's hearts and minds
Were praying for the land
To see its lovely skies
Now we're there to hope
Peace will soon arrive
A peace for all of us
Shalom for all man kind
Chorus: x2
I dream of peace in all the world, oh let it be now
I dream of love and harmony, so let it be
I dream of peace in all the world, so let me see how
I want the world to sing a peaceful melody

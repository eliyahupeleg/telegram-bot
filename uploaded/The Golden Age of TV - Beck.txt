The Golden Age of TV
המערכת

Put your hands on the wheel 

Let the golden age begin 

Let the window down 

Feel the moonlight on your skin 

Let the desert wind 

Cool your aching head 

Let the weight of the world 

Drift away instead 

 

Ohh, these days I barely get by 

I don't even try 

 

It's a treacherous road 

With a desolated view 

There's distant lights 

But here they're far and few 

And the sun don't shine 

Even when it's day 

You gotta drive all night 

Just to feel like you're ok 

 

Ohh, these days I barely get by 

I don't even try 

I don't even try

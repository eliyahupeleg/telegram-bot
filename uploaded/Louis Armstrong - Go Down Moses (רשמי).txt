Go down Moses 

Way down in egypt land 

Tell all Pharaoes to 

Let My People Go 

 

When Israel was in Egypt land... 

Let My People Go 

 

Oppressed so hard 

They could not stand... 

Let My People Go 

 

So the God seyeth: 'Go down, Moses 

Way down in Egypt land  

Tell all Pharaoes to 

Let My People Go' 

 

So Moses went to Egypt land... 

Let My People Go 

 

He made all Pharaoes understand... 

Let My People Go 

Yes The Lord said 'Go down, Moses 

Way down in Egypt land  

Tell all Pharaoes to 

Let My People Go' 

 

Thus spoke the Lord 

Bold Moses said: 

-Let My People Go 

'If not I'll smite 

Your firstborn's dead' 

-Let My People Go 

 

God-The Lord said 'Go down, Moses 

Way down in Egypt land  

Tell all Pharaoes to 

Let My People Go' 

 

Tell all Pharaoes 

To 

Let My People Go
